## Project Security Policy (Governance)

### Reporting Vulnerabilities (Responsible Disclosure)
- Preferred contact: security@d0-os.org (subject: “Vulnerability Report”).
- Include: affected commit/UUID, minimal PoC, impact, CVSS vector (if available).
- Optional encrypted report: provide a PGP public key at `Documents/SECURITY-PUBKEY.asc`.
- Acknowledgement target: 48 hours. Status updates at least weekly until resolution.

### Supported Versions / Branches
- Active development: `main` (security fixes accepted; highest priority).
- Tagged releases: latest minor on the most recent major receives security fixes.
- Long-term support (LTS): to be defined at first stable; backports for Critical/High.

### Disclosure and Remediation SLAs
- Triage within 48 hours; severity assigned using CVSS 3.1.
- Remediation targets (guideline):
  - Critical: 14 days
  - High: 30 days
  - Medium: 60 days
  - Low: best effort
- Coordinated disclosure: public advisory after fix is available or by mutual agreement.

### Security Updates & Advisories
- Advisories are published under `Documents/Advisories/` and via mailing list.
- Each advisory includes: impact, affected ranges, fixed versions, workarounds, credits, CVE (if assigned).

### Secure Coding & Review
- Mandatory code review by at least one security-trained reviewer for changes touching:
  - memory management, parsers, crypto, virtualization, networking, boot.
- Prohibited patterns: hard-coded secrets/keys, unchecked buffers, UB in assembly.
- Assembly guidelines: bounds-checked memory ops; clear calling conventions; CFI annotations; avoid self-modifying code.

### Dependency & Supply Chain Policy
- Allowed sources: pinned, verified (cryptographic checksums/tags).
- SBOM generation per build (SPDX/CycloneDX) with artifact UUIDv7 linkage.
- Update cadence: monthly dependency review; out-of-cycle for security.
- License scanning required; incompatible licenses rejected.

### Build Integrity & Signing
- Immutable build artifacts signed (Ed25519). Public key embedded in kernel.
- Provenance: generate provenance/attestation for each build (SLSA-style), bound to UUIDv7.
- Reproducibility: aim for bit-for-bit reproducible builds within Dockerized toolchain.

### Keys & Secrets
- Signing keys stored in HSM or hardware-backed keystore on the build system.
- Key rotation policy: annual or on compromise; publish new public key with deprecation window.
- No secrets in repo; enforce secrets scanning in CI (e.g., gitleaks/regex gates).

### Security Tooling (CI/CD gates)
- Static analysis: clang-tidy/llvm-mca for assembly patterns; CodeQL where applicable.
- Dependency scanning: OSV advisories check.
- Fuzzing: structured fuzzers for TLV parser, virtio queues, EPT mapper (host-side harness).
- Binary hardening verification: check for RELRO/CFI/CFPROT/NOEXECSTACK.
- Secrets scanning and license checks on every PR.

### Configuration Hardening (Deploy)
- Enforce: no host interactive shell; mgmt plane disabled by default.
- Verify: signature over manifest TLV; fail-closed if verify fails.
- Static networking only; no DHCP servers enabled in host.
- Enable watchdog and auto-rollback for A/B slots with last-good UUIDv7.

### Threat Model (Summary)
- Assets: boot chain, manifest/signing keys, VM isolation (EPT), network plane, TLV parser.
- Adversaries: local attacker with device access; remote network attacker; supply-chain attacker.
- Mitigations: signature verification, W^X/CFI/RELRO, strict parsers, minimal TCB, no host shell, immutable updates.

### Incident Response (Process Details)
- Intake → triage (CVSS) → patch → backport (if applicable) → advisory → postmortem.
- Evidence handling: preserve logs/ring buffers; snapshot failing artifacts where feasible.
- Communication: private until fix; coordinate with reporters for credits.

### Community Guidelines
- Be professional; avoid sharing exploit details publicly before fixes.
- Use GitHub labels: `security`, `needs-triage`, `backport`, `advisory`.
- Prefer minimal PoCs and deterministic repro steps.

### Bug Bounty (Placeholder)
- No formal bounty at this time; responsible disclosures are appreciated and credited in advisories.

### Document Versioning
- SECURITY.md changes are tracked in git; major policy changes called out in release notes.

## Live OS (RAM‑Only) Model and Container Storage Writes

### Live OS Constraints (RAM‑only)
- Runtime is entirely in RAM; no persistent host writes after boot.
- Boot media (ESP) is mounted read‑only for the lifetime of the system.
- Host root uses ramfs/tmpfs; swap is disabled; no writable block devices.
- Update model is immutable: rebuild a new signed image, flip boot slot, reboot.
- Logs/metrics remain in memory (ring buffers/tmpfs); optional serial output; no on‑disk logs.
- Secrets and ephemeral keys are regenerated at each boot; nothing persists across reboots.

### Storage Writes: Scope and Ephemerality
- All meaningful writes are confined to containers/VMs and are volatile:
  - Per‑container writable layer: RAM copy‑on‑write (COW) overlay for the guest rootfs (application writes, /var, /tmp, logs).
  - Per‑VM runtime buffers: virtio TX/RX queues, page cache, scratch buffers (RAM only).
  - Host runtime scratch: tmpfs for temporary artifacts, manifest parsing, and diagnostics.
- Base VM/container images are treated as read‑only; they are copied/attached into RAM before launch.
- No host disk writes for container data; all container writes are cleared on reboot.
- Persistent data is out of scope by default. If persistence is required in the future, it must be provided via explicit external storage integrations (not enabled in the Live OS profile).

### Memory Budgeting & Admission Control
- Total RAM must accommodate: host core + VMX/EPT/EPTP tables + virtio queues + Σ(guest RAM + RAM COW overlays) + safety margin.
- Admission controller (policy):
  - Refuse to launch additional VMs/containers when projected RAM usage exceeds threshold.
  - Enforce per‑VM quotas for RAM and overlay RAM; deny‑by‑default when uncertain.
- OOM policy: fail closed (reject new workloads); never enable swap.
- Teardown policy: zero/scrub sensitive in‑RAM pages (keys, credentials) on VM/container exit.

### Static Networking (Live Profile)
- Deterministic, static MAC/IP assignment per manifest; no DHCP services.
- Optional egress NAT policy; no L2 learning; minimal, predictable forwarding.

### Container Security Best Practices (RAM‑only)
- Least privilege: constrain capabilities, syscalls, and devices; mount read‑only where possible; writable layer remains RAM‑backed and bounded. See container security best practices for capability minimization and hardening [spot.io](https://spot.io/resources/container-security/what-is-container-security-risks-solutions-and-best-practices/?utm_source=openai).
- Secrets management: inject secrets at runtime via ephemeral mechanisms (e.g., in‑memory env or guest tmpfs); prohibit writing secrets to image; avoid persisting secrets in writable layers. Guidance on secrets handling and challenges in container environments [medium.com](https://medium.com/%40peris.ai/container-security-challenges-and-how-to-overcome-them-3f1fa70f8808?utm_source=openai).
- Resource limits: set CPU, RAM, and I/O budgets per container to prevent noisy‑neighbor and DoS; align quotas with admission control to honor headroom. Quick steps for secure container usage and limiting resources [insights.sei.cmu.edu](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/7-quick-steps-to-using-containers-securely/?utm_source=openai).
- Writable layer hygiene: isolate per container/VM; no sharing; ensure wipe on teardown and system reboot.
- Image immutability: base images are read‑only and verified; any runtime changes occur only in the RAM overlay.

### Security Implications of Live OS
- Reduced persistence risk: compromise does not survive a reboot (no runtime writes).
- Stronger supply‑chain focus: protect boot images and signatures; the ESP is the only trusted input at boot.
- Manifest signature verification is mandatory; failure triggers fail‑closed behavior and rollback.
- UEFI NVRAM usage is limited to last‑good UUIDv7 and slot selection; no user data is stored.

### Operational Guidance (Live)
- Expect all application state to reset on reboot; design workloads accordingly.
- For diagnostics, export logs before reboot via approved out‑of‑band paths (e.g., serial capture) if required.
- Size host RAM with adequate headroom for peak Σ(guest RAM + overlays) and transport buffers.
