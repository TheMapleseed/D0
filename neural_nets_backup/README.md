call neural_mutate_init

# Initialize neural network core
call neural_net_init

# Initialize communication (node 0, 4 total nodes)
mov $0, %rdi
mov $4, %rsi
call neural_comm_init
```

### **Training**
```assembly
# Forward pass with learning
mov input_ptr, %rdi
mov target_ptr, %rsi
mov output_ptr, %rdx
call neural_net_learn

# Apply mutations
call neural_mutate_evolve

# Synchronize with other nodes
call neural_comm_sync
```

### **Prediction**
```assembly
# Forward pass only (no learning)
mov input_ptr, %rdi
mov output_ptr, %rsi
call neural_net_predict
```

## **Integration Notes**

These systems were designed for:
- **Real-time adaptation** to changing environments
- **Distributed learning** across multiple processors
- **Hardware-accelerated** neural computations
- **Evolutionary optimization** of network parameters
- **Dynamic resource management** based on neural analysis

The preserved implementation maintains full functionality for future integration or research purposes.
