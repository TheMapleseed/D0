# Live Neural System (D0)
> A self-learning, self-healing x86_64 assembly ProxMox like OS with neural network integration

## ðŸ§¬ Overview
D0 is an experimental assembly-level system that combines neural network capabilities with low-level system operations. 
It creates a self-adapting, self-healing computing environment that learns from its operations and can recover from failures autonomously.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- **Neural Learning**: Real-time pattern recognition and adaptation
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic error detection and recovery
- **Pattern Memory**: Adaptive memory management system
- **Circular Verification**: Continuous system integrity checking
- **Hot Reloading**: Live system updates without downtime
- **Docker Integration**: Containerized build and test environment
- **VM-Based Transport Layer**: Secure isolation of network stack in VM space
- **High-Performance Networking**: Support for standard Ethernet, high-speed Ethernet (up to 800G), and InfiniBand

## ðŸ’¡ Innovation
D0 pushes the boundaries of traditional computing by:
- Implementing neural networks at the assembly level
- Creating self-modifying, stable code patterns
- Providing autonomous system maintenance
- Learning from operational patterns
- Adapting to hardware changes in real-time
- Isolating network transport layers in VM space for enhanced security

## ðŸ”¬ Technical Stack
- x86_64 Assembly
- Neural Network Pattern Generation
- Support for Linux Containers, all the way up to commercial Docker containers
- Hammer 2 style filesystem with thin provisioning support
- Automated Build Pipeline
- Lightweight VM Hypervisor
- High-Performance Network Stack
