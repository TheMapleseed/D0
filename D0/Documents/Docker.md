This will:
    1. Start the system in a safe test environment
    2. Let you watch it work
    3. Show you what it's learning
    
    ## 🧠 How It Works
    
    ### The Brain (Neural Network)
    - Lives in `neural_mutate.s`
    - Learns from everything that happens
    - Creates patterns to protect the system
    - Can fix problems it finds
    
    ### Memory (Pattern System)
    - Keeps track of what works
    - Remembers good solutions
    - Helps prevent mistakes
    
    ### Self-Healing
    - Can fix problems automatically
    - Makes backups of important stuff
    - Learns from mistakes to prevent future problems
    
    ## 📁 Important Files
    - `Live0.s`: The system starter
    - `neural_mutate.s`: The learning brain
    - `memory_regions.s`: Memory manager
    - `binary_healing.s`: Self-repair system
    - `sync.s`: Keeps everything working together
    - `device_manager.s`: Handles hardware
    
    ## 🔄 The Boot Process
    1. System starts up
    2. Checks if everything is okay
    3. Neural network wakes up
    4. Creates safety patterns
    5. Starts watching for problems
    6. Ready to use!
    
    ## 🛠️ Building Your Own Version
    
    ### Requirements
    - A Linux computer
    - Basic development tools
    - Patience (it's learning!)
    
    ### Steps
    1. Clone the repository
    2. Run `./build.sh`
    3. Test with `./deploy.sh`
    4. Watch it learn!
    
    ## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong
    Don't worry! The system can:
    1. Fix itself in most cases
    2. Roll back to a working version
    3. Learn from what went wrong
    4. Prevent the same problem next time
    
    ## 🔍 Watching It Work
    You can see what's happening:
    - Check the logs in `logs/deploy.log`
    - Watch the neural network learn
    - See how it fixes problems
