# Live Neural System (LNS)
> A self-learning, self-healing x86_64 assembly system with neural network integration

## ðŸ§¬ Overview
LNS is an experimental assembly-level system that combines neural network capabilities with low-level system operations. It creates a self-adapting, self-healing computing environment that learns from its operations and can recover from failures autonomously.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- **Neural Learning**: Real-time pattern recognition and adaptation
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic error detection and recovery
- **Pattern Memory**: Adaptive memory management system
- **Circular Verification**: Continuous system integrity checking
- **Hot Reloading**: Live system updates without downtime
- **Docker Integration**: Containerized build and test environment

## ðŸ’¡ Innovation
LNS pushes the boundaries of traditional computing by:
- Implementing neural networks at the assembly level
- Creating self-modifying, stable code patterns
- Providing autonomous system maintenance
- Learning from operational patterns
- Adapting to hardware changes in real-time

## ðŸ”¬ Technical Stack
- x86_64 Assembly
- Neural Network Pattern Generation
- Docker Containerization
- QEMU System Emulation
- Automated Build Pipeline

## ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases
- System Reliability Research
- Self-Healing Computing
- Pattern Recognition Development
- Neural Network Integration
- Low-Level System Learning

## ðŸš€ Status
Active Development - Experimental
