## üöÄ Building the System

### Prerequisites

## üóÑÔ∏è Filesystem Features

The D0 system includes an optional Hammer2-style filesystem specifically designed for container image storage with the following features:

### Conditional Initialization
- The filesystem is not created by default and requires explicit configuration
- Cold storage requires only enough space for the OS itself
- Filesystem can be enabled via boot parameters or configuration files

### Container Image Management
- Efficient container image storage with thin provisioning
- Snapshot capabilities using Copy-on-Write (COW)
- Container image versioning and rollback

### Security Features
- Complete isolation from the OS image
- OpenBSD-inspired memory protection mechanisms
- Secure memory regions for filesystem operations
- Cryptographic verification of data integrity

### Compatibility
- Designed for Docker and Kubernetes compatibility
- Kata Containers support
- Polymorphic cluster capabilities
- Agentic operations support

## üåê Network Features

D0 includes comprehensive networking support for high-performance container orchestration:

### Standard Ethernet
- Full 1G/10G/25G Ethernet support
- Industry-standard frame formats
- Jumbo frame support
- Standard checksum offloads

### High-Speed Ethernet
- 100G/200G/400G/800G Ethernet support
- Forward Error Correction (FEC)
- Advanced packet offload capabilities
- Multi-queue optimization

### InfiniBand
- SDR through XDR (up to 800 Gbps) support
- RDMA capabilities for direct memory access
- Queue Pair management
- Low-latency operations

### Advanced Features
- RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet)
- Secure memory isolation for network operations
- Advanced flow control
- QoS support with Traffic Classes
- Hardware offload capabilities for encryption and checksums

## üîê VM-Based Transport Layer

D0 implements a unique VM-based approach to network transport layers:

### Architecture
- Complete isolation of TCP/IP stack in dedicated VM spaces
- Lightweight hypervisor optimized for network operations
- Shared memory ring buffers for efficient packet exchange
- Zero-copy support for high-performance networking

### Security Benefits
- Transport layer vulnerabilities contained within VM boundaries
- Memory isolation between different container network stacks
- EPT (Extended Page Tables) protection of network memory
- Reduced attack surface for network exploits

### Performance
- Para-virtualized I/O for minimal overhead
- Multi-queue support for parallel packet processing
- Hardware offload capabilities passed through to VM
- Dynamic resource allocation based on container requirements

### Container Integration
- Each container can have its own isolated transport VM
- Support for standard container networking models (bridge, macvlan, ipvlan)
- Network namespace integration
- Compatible with container orchestration platforms

### Customization
- Per-container network policies
- VM-based network function virtualization
- Custom protocol support
- Flexible routing capabilities

## üîí Security Model

The security model follows OpenBSD principles:

1. **Isolation**: All components operate in separate memory regions
2. **Privilege Separation**: Operations run with minimal required permissions
3. **W^X (Write XOR Execute)**: Memory cannot be simultaneously writable and executable
4. **Address Randomization**: Memory locations are randomized for security
5. **Cryptographic Verification**: All operations are verified for integrity
6. **VM Boundaries**: Network transport layers are isolated in dedicated VM spaces
